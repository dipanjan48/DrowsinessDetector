# DrowsinessDetector
The project can be used to detect if a person is drowsy

For our training and test data, we used the Real-Life Drowsiness Dataset created by a research team from the University of Texas at Arlington specifically for detecting multi-stage drowsiness. The end goal is to detect not only extreme and visible cases of drowsiness but allow our system to detect softer signals of drowsiness as well. The dataset consists of around 30 hours of videos of 60 unique participants. From the dataset, we were able to extract facial landmarks from 44 videos of 22 participants. This allowed us to obtain a sufficient amount of data for both the alert and drowsy state
